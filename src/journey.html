            <h2>My Journey in the ENVISIONEERING Summer Bridge Program:</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>I have really enjoyed my journey in the ENVISIONEERING Summer Bridge Program. When coming into the program, I knew hardly anything about coding or how to code. But the two CE classes offered at the program: WEB 1400 and CS 1030 have really helped to expand my understanding of the subject. During my freshman year, I took AP Computer Science and scored a 2 on the exam. Overall, I didn't learn much during the year in that class. But, over these past 7 weeks at ENVISIONEERING, I have learned way more than I have over the whole school year in that class. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In WEB 1400, I learned how to code in HTML and use CSS such as Flexbox and Grid. I learned UX and UI Design and how to do both overall. We started out with just simply creating a webpage and doing CSS Designs. Then, we moved on to how to create tables and forms and advanced CSS. After that, we learned how to use Flexbox and Grid layouts. Now, we are finishing up final projects that incoporate all of these skills we learned over the past 7 weeks.   </p>
